PLAIN REACT - OLD WAY
const plainHeading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading", xyz: "abc" },
  "Hello world from react!"
); 

ReactElement is Object which becomes HTML that browser understands
React.createElement => ReactElement(Object) => HTMLElement (render)

JSX - is not HTML in JS
HTML-like or XML-like syntax

const heading = (
  <h1 id="heading" className="head" tabIndex="1">
    Hello world from jsx
  </h1>
);

JSX => Babel transpiles it to React.createElement => ReactElement(Object) => HTMLElement (render)

it is not valid pure javascript
if js engine is not able to understand this then how code id working?
code is working because PARCEL(BABEL) is doing the job behind the scenes
this code is transpiled before it goes to js engine
transpile means this code is converted into code which browser understands.

React Component
- Class based Component (OLD WAY)
- Functional Component (NEW WAY) - Just a normal js function which returns jsx code or react element

Component Composition: Component inside Component

Cross-site scripting attack
